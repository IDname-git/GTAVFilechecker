## Description

This script checks whether the installed GTA 5 matches the expected version and verifies key game files for correct sizes. It supports two display modes: progress bar or detailed list.

---

## Usage

1. Run the script.  
2. Enter the GTA 5 installation path if not already saved.  
3. Choose the display mode (progress bar or list).  
4. The script verifies the version and files, then outputs the results.

---

## Important Notes

- The `version.txt` file in the game directory is compared to the scriptâ€™s version (1.0.231.0).  
- If `version.txt` is missing or the path is incorrect, the script will exit with an error.  
- File sizes are checked in kilobytes to ensure integrity.  
- Official file updates or changes may cause false positives.  
- This tool is **for educational purposes only** and is provided without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

---

## Installation and Configuration

- The script saves the GTA path and display mode in `config.json` located at `%APPDATA%\gta5filechecker\`.  
- Delete the config file to reset the path and display mode input if needed.
